# Chrisert - Business Website

A business website for a fully-working construction services company. 

## 📋 About

Currently working on a side project that will serve as the official website for a construction services company that specializes in applying ETICS (External Thermal Insulation Composite Systems) to both commercial and residential properties, providing thermal and acoustic insulation solutions for their clients. 

Built with React and JavaScript, styled using Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI components. The project follows a professional development workflow with GitHub Pages as a staging/test environment and Netlify for production deployment. Unit and component testing is handled with Vitest to ensure code reliability.

This is a frontend-focused website that leverages Netlify Forms for contact handling, eliminating the need for a complex backend infrastructure since there's no heavy business logic or database requirements involved. 

Optimized for performance and SEO to maximize the company's online visibility.  Fully responsive design ensuring a seamless experience across all devices. 

A hands-on project bridging web development skills with real business needs.
